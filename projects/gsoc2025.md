## The Challenge

The client needed a modern e-commerce platform that could handle thousands of products and concurrent users while maintaining a smooth shopping experience.

## My Approach

I designed a scalable architecture using microservices pattern, with separate services for:
- Product catalog management
- User authentication and profiles
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Payment processing
- Order management

## Key Features

- **Real-time inventory tracking** - Products update in real-time across all user sessions
- **Smart search** - Elasticsearch integration for fast, relevant product search
- **Secure payments** - PCI-compliant payment processing with Stripe
- **Admin dashboard** - Comprehensive analytics and management tools

## Results

- 200% increase in conversion rate
- 50ms average page load time
- 99.9% uptime in the first year
- Processing over $1M in transactions monthly
